=head2 CLEARING METHODS/ATTRIBUTES

We have so far seen many ways to add methods, attributes and accessors to a
quick object. But you can also clear them! This is particularly useful in
strict objects where they will not autovivify back into existance.

One again there are 2 ways to clear an attribute or method. The original way
using the C<qclear> method, and the new way using the control object.

    # Remove the foo() attribute and any associated value/method
    $obj->foo( qclear() );

    # Remove a whole list of attributes
    $control->clear( qw/foo bar baz/ );
